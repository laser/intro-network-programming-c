# Lab 8

## Part 1

Write one last implementation of your server using the `poll(2)`
function described in the lecture notes. Compare its throughput
with the other servers you've built.

### Acceptance Criteria

1. Your server must use `poll` instead of forking child processes
   and/or spawning threads.
