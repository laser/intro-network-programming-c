# Assignment 8

## Part 1

Write one last implementation of your server called 
`multiplexed-db-server` using the `poll` function described in the 
reading. Compare its throughput with the other servers you've built.

### Acceptance Criteria

1. Your server must use `poll` instead of forking child processes
   and/or spawning threads.
